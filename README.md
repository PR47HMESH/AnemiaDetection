Introduction:
Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy Red Blood Cells (RBCs) to carry oxygen to body parts. Having anemia is also referred to as low Hemoglobin.
In this project we will be detecting anemia through machine learning by using Logistic Regression.
The detection will be done through various components consisting “Gender”, “Hemoglobin”, “MCH”, “MCHC”, “MCV”.
The plotting of various graphs is done to help understand the DataFrame/ Database or simply Data.

Modules:
pip install numpy
